On Day 3, Santa delivers presents on an infinite 2D grid of houses based on directions from an elf. The elf's directions, 
influenced by eggnog, may cause Santa to revisit some houses. The task is to determine how many houses receive at least one present. 
Examples illustrate the outcomes for different sets of directions, highlighting instances of revisiting houses.

Code:
import array
with open("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\\AOC\\DayThree2015.txt") as file:
    line = file.read()
Input: list[chr] = [char for char in line]
UD = 0
LR = 0
def readthroughUD(input, ud):
    upDown: int = 0
    if input == '^':
        upDown = upDown +1
    elif input == 'v':
        upDown = upDown-1
    ud = ud + upDown
    return ud
def readthroughLR(input, lr):
    leftRight: int = 0
    if input == '<':
        leftRight = leftRight -1
    elif input == '>':
        leftRight = leftRight +1
    lr = lr + leftRight
    return lr

mydict: dict = {UD:[LR]}
for a in Input:
    UD = readthroughUD(a, UD)
    LR = readthroughLR(a, LR)
    if UD in mydict.keys():
        if LR in mydict[UD]:
            continue
        else:
            mydict[UD].append(LR)
    else:
        mydict[UD] = [LR]
i = 0
for key in mydict.keys():
    for values in mydict[key]:
        i = i+1
print(i)

2572 Houses get at least one present
