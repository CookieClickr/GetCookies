Same as Day 4.1 just with 6 zeros
Took my laptop like 15 seconds to run through this I was allready wondering what could have gone wrong
But I haven't changed much, only the if-statement for the round and count variable in the CheckCharArray method/funktion.

Code:
import hashlib
# import string input: ckczppom
# loop that goes through them
# add numbers to the end starting at 0
# convert to one string: input + number
# hash it
# convert to char array and see if it checks out else number+1
# if it has 5 leading zeros break the loop and output number

def hexadigest(number: int, input: str):
    convert = input + str(number)
    result = hashlib.md5(convert.encode())
    return result.hexdigest()
def CheckCharArray(input: str):
    CharArray = [char for char in input]
    count: int = 0
    round: int = 0
    for possibleZero in CharArray:
        if possibleZero == '0':
            count = count + 1
        if count == 6:
            return True
        round = round + 1
        if round == 6:
            return False

input: str = "ckczppom"
getThemZeros = False
number = 0
gethashing = "X"
while getThemZeros == False:
    gethashing = hexadigest(number, input)
    getThemZeros = CheckCharArray(gethashing)
    number = number + 1
print(number)
print(gethashing)

The number is: 3938039
The hexadecimal equivalent to the MD5 hash is: 00000028023e3b4729684757f8dc3fbf
