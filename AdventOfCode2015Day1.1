Because I am a complete beginner with python, I am going to use the challenges from the Webseite Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1). 
Here one can find a lot coding problems with in creasing difficulty. I am going to start with Day 1 of 2015 because it starts fairly easy.

This one is easy to explain. Santa is in a builing and he has instructions where he should deliver a present. '(' means go up one floor and ')' down one. 
The input is one long string containing only '(' and ')'. The question is on witch floor he ends up after the instructions.

import array
with open("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\\AOC\\DayOne2015") as file:
    for line in file:
        my_Input = line.rstrip()

to_array = [char for char in my_Input]
x = 0
for a in to_array:
    if a == '(':
        x = x + 1
    else:
        x = x - 1

print(x)
