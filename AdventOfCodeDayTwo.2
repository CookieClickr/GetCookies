Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

In Part 2 of the task, the elves need to determine the total feet of ribbon required to wrap presents, 
considering the two smallest perimeter for each present to wrap it and the cubic feet of volume for the bow, based on the given dimensions.
Example: A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2+2+3+3 = 10 feet of ribbon to wrap the present plus 2*3*4 = 24 feet of ribbon for the bow, for a total of 34 feet.

I just changed my doCalc function.
Code:
import array
with open("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Documents\\AOC\\DayTwo2015") as file:
    lines = [x.rstrip() for x in file]
erg = 0
def doCalc(w,l,h):
    myrealIntegers: list = [(2*l+2*w), (2*w+2*h), (2*h+2*l)]
    erg: int = w*l*h + min(myrealIntegers)

    return erg
def intParse(value):
    try:
        return int(value)
    except ValueError:
        return value
for line in lines:
    myIntAsStrList: list = line.split("x")
    w: int = intParse(myIntAsStrList[0])
    l: int = intParse(myIntAsStrList[1])
    h: int = intParse(myIntAsStrList[2])

    erg: int = erg + doCalc(w, l, h)
print(erg)
Das Ergebnis is 3737498.
